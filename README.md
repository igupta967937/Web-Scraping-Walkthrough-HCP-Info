# Web Scrapper

### Introduction
I felt it would be interesting to consolidate a dataset of licensed healthcare professionals in Singapore, and run some analysis on it. To gather this dataset, I had to perform web scrapping on the Ministry of Health (MOH) Healthcare Professionals page to retrieve this publicly available information. This page is meant for the public to readily locate healthcare professionals in Singapore, and this includes doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, and other practitioners.

Being a pharmacist myself, it was natural to start on the Pharmacists dataset.

### Methods

The details are described in the Jupyter notebook.

To run the code directly, you can use the .py file

### Challenges
There are multiple challenges to tackle when scrapping from the MOH website. As a result of this, the Python script had to undergo multiple iterations of adjustments in order to get the web scrapping process done right.
